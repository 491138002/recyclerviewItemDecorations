This project showcases some ItemDecorations for RecyclerViews. I wrote blog posts explaining the [basics of drawing decorations](http://blog.davidmedenjak.com/android/2015/11/10/recyclerview-with-decorations-basic-guide.html) and [animating them along with the recyclerview](http://blog.davidmedenjak.com/android/2015/11/18/decorations-animations.html).

## Library

If you find something appealing, please go ahead and just copy it. The MIT license applies. Up to this point I don't see it fit being published as a library. Currently this project is just my personal playground in which I will try out RecyclerView features.

I will not yet be officially releasing any code, because it is not thoroughly tested and I did not yet want to go that extra step.

## Current features

* Made a lightweight header decoration with shadow and / or parallax effect

* Added a decoration for dismissing items to draw in the background like Gmail

* Tried adding some CardLayout like Decoration to a RecyclerView.
* Added some Parallax Like effect on a header
