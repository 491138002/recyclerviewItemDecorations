This project is about showcasing and trying out ItemDecorations for RecyclerViews. There's some blog posts on this topic already [Here](http://bleeding182.blogspot.co.at/2015/11/separator.html) and [Here](http://bleeding182.blogspot.co.at/2015/11/animations-and-decorations.html) covering the basics on how to use decorations.

* Tried adding some CardLayout like Decoration to a RecyclerView.
* Made a lightweight header decoration with shadow and / or parallax effect
