This project showcases ItemDecorations for RecyclerViews. For some general guidance you can see 2 blog posts on this topic by me [here](http://bleeding182.blogspot.co.at/2015/11/separator.html) and [here](http://bleeding182.blogspot.co.at/2015/11/animations-and-decorations.html) which should cover the basics of drawing decorations.

## Library

If you find something appealing, please go ahead and just copy it. The MIT license applies. Up to this point I don't see it fit being published as a library. Currently this project is just my personal playground in which I will try out RecyclerView features.

I will not yet be officially releasing any code, because it is not thoroughly tested and I did not yet want to go that extra step.

## Current features

* Made a lightweight header decoration with shadow and / or parallax effect

* Added a decoration for dismissing items to draw in the background like Gmail

* Tried adding some CardLayout like Decoration to a RecyclerView.
* Added some Parallax Like effect on a header
